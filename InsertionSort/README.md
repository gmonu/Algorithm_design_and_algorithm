Hey! The Menu Driven program for the sorting algorithms (Insertion sort, Selection sort, and Binary sort) have presented well.
Just a little suggestion if you don't mind, writing program with enough indentation (some portion of program have indentation but not whole). Thus it would increase the readability of code. 
But overall code is really good.

Thanks for sharing the code.
